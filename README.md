##  Dataset Used

- Dataset Name: Mall_Customers.csv  
- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
- **Features Used:
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1â€“100)

## What I Did

1. Loaded & explored the dataset** using pandas.
2. Selected relevant features** for clustering.
3. Standardized** the data using `StandardScaler`.
4. Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. Trained a K-Means model with 5 clusters.
6. Visualized the resulting clusters.
7. Saved:
   - Clustered output to `results/customer_segments.csv`
   - Elbow curve and cluster plots
   - Trained model as `kmeans_model.pkl`
